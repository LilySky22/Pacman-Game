# Pacman-Game

## for this game I followed a tutorial on how to make a pacman web game. I plan to completely change the style, give it a different theme and add different speeds and things

## I remember doing something similar when I was younger, but I don't think I ever finished it, but if you're reading this then I will have completed it

## I am extremely slow at programming even when following a tutorial and i'm still trying to figure out the best way to learn. In this project I have had to completely restart because I messed up

## demo link:


### issues I have faced so far are: 
#### Movement controls - the left arrow works perfectly, the others are glitchy, 
#### Setting rules for ghosts - I have managed to get the ghosts to mmove randomly but this means they sometimes end up in walls, 
#### Changing Sprites - I want to add my own designs for the ghosts and pacman, but becuase the tutorial has them as just a pixel I need to figure out how to fix that

### Fixes:
#### Movement controls - The right and down arrow key had - instead of +
