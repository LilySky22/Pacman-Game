# Pacman-Game

## for this game I followed a tutorial on how to make a pacman web game. I plan to completely change the style, give it a different theme and add different speeds and things

## I remember doing something similar when I was younger, but I don't think I ever finished it, but if you're reading this then I will have completed it

## I am extremely slow at programming even when following a tutorial and i'm still trying to figure out the best way to learn. In this project I have had to completely restart because I messed up
